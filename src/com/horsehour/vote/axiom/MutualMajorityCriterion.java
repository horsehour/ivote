/**
 *
 * The mutual majority criterion is also known as the majority criterion for
 * solid coalitions and the generalized majority criterion. The criterion
 * states: if there is a subset S of the candidates such that more than half of
 * the voters strictly prefer every member of S to every candidate outside of S,
 * and this majority votes sincerely, then the winner must come from S. This is
 * similar to but more strict than the majority criterion, where the requirement
 * applies only to the case that S contains a single candidate.
 * <p>
 * Methods that pass: The Schulze method, ranked pairs, instant-runoff voting,
 * Nanson's method, Bucklin voting.
 * <p>
 * Methods that fail: plurality, approval voting, range voting, the Borda count,
 * minimax.
