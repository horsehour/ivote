/**
 * IIA - Independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion (a.k.a binary
 * independence or independence axiom). It's often interpreted as, if one
 * candidate (X) wins the election, and a new alternative (Y) is added, only X
 * or Y will win the election.
 * <p>
 * An anecdote which illustrates a violation of this property has been
 * attributed to Sidney Morgenbesser: <i> After finishing dinner, Sidney
 * Morgenbesser decides to order dessert. The waitress tells him he has two
 * choices: apple pie and blueberry pie. Sidney orders the apple pie. After a
 * few minutes the waitress returns and says that they also have cherry pie at
 * which point Morgenbesser says "In that case I'll have the blueberry pie."</i>
 * <p>
 * Approval voting and range voting satisfy the independence of irrelevant
 * alternatives criterion. Another cardinal system, cumulative voting, does not
 * satisfy the criterion. All voting systems have some degree of inherent
 * susceptibility to strategic nomination considerations. Some regard these
 * considerations as less serious unless the voting system specifically fails
 * the (easier to satisfy) independence of clones criterion.
