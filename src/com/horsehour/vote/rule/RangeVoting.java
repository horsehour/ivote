/**
 * Range voting is a voting system for one-seat elections under which voters
 * score each candidate, the scores are added up, and the candidate with the
 * highest score wins. Range voting is also known ratings summation, average
 * voting, cardinal ratings, score voting, 0â€“99 voting, the score system, or the
 * point system.
 * <p>
 * A form of range voting was apparently used in some elections in Ancient
 * Sparta by measuring how loudly the crowd shouted for different candidates;
 * rough modern-day equivalents include the use of clapometers in some
 * television shows and the judging processes of some athletic competitions.
 * <p>
 * Range voting satisfies the monotonicity criterion, i.e. raising your vote's
 * score for a candidate can never hurt their chances of winning. Also, in range
 * voting, casting a sincere vote can never result in a worse election winner
 * (from your point of view) than if you had simply abstained from voting. Range
 * voting passes the favorite betrayal criterion, meaning that it never gives
 * voters an incentive to rate their favorite candidate lower than a candidate
 * they like less.
